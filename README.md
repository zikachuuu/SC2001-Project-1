compOverSize.py and compOverS.py corresponds to qn ci and cii respectively. All they do is create a csv file in result folder (make sure to create that in the same directory as all the python files beforehand!)<br>
main.py (todo) is meant to use the csv files created to plot graphs (using panda probably)<br>
originalHyrbid.py is qn d<br>
sorting.py is where all the sorting codes are. The key comparisons counting prob have some bugs as the hybrid merge sort will give more key comparisons than the original merge sort for any chosen S (even if shorter run time)<br>
